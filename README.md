# Car_amount_prediction_project
Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict car purchasing amounts based on historical data. Achieved a high prediction accuracy by optimizing model parameters and leveraging data preprocessing techniques. Demonstrated expertise in regression tasks, data analysis, and model evaluation

Then,I have some steps to completed my project :-


1.IMPORT PYTHON LIBRARIES

2.LOAD DATASET

3.TRAINING DATASET AND DATA CLEANING

4.TRAINING THE MODEL

5.EVALUATING THE MODEL
