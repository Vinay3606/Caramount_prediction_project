Developed a sentiment analysis model for IMDb movie reviews using techniques such as text preprocessing, Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings. Implemented machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest to classify reviews as positive or negative, achieving high accuracy rates. Demonstrated expertise in handling text data, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Then,I have some steps to completed my project :-


1.IMPORT PYTHON LIBRARIES

2.LOAD DATASET

3.TRAINING DATASET AND DATA CLEANING

4.TRAINING THE MODEL

5.EVALUATING THE MODEL
